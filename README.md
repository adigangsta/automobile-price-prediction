# automobile-price-prediction
This project utilizes the statistical foundations of predictive data analytics using the R
programming language on the Automobile dataset, which consists of data from 1985 Wardâ€™s
Automotive Yearbook. The project is divided into two phases, where the first phase is concerned
with developing a model to accurately predict the price of listed automobiles, while the
second phase involves clustering various makes of cars on the basis of their specifications and
features.

The final objective of my analysis is to create a recommendation system which would integrate
the price forecasts from the first model with the cluster groups from the second model
and help customers pick a vehicle of their choice or help car manufacturing companies identify
segments for their advertising or production purposes.

While statistical measures lay the foundations for data-driven projects, cars must also be
analysed through intuition, influence, and rational. Therefore, alongside statistical knowledge,
I will use intuition and creativity along the way to make strategic decisions while building the
models that could convey data-driven insights for future automobile productions. This report
will help consumers pick an ideal car on the basis of their needs and also manufacturers to
target certain segments of the population they want to cater to using the insights provided.

A gradient boosted decision tree was used to model the first phase, which was forecasting prices
of cars. The clustering of different makes of cars was done using the K-Means algorithm on a PCA 
transformed dataset.
